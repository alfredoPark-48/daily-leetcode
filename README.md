# Data Structures and Algorithms Exercises
## Objective
I will be solving questions from Grind 75 with a schedule of 26 weeks and 2 hours per week in order to reinforce Data Structures and Algorithms concepts.
## Languages
The languages I will be using for my solutions will be in Typescript and Python, the two languages I am most comfortable with.
### Week 1
- Two Sum (Difficulty - Easy):
The approach I used was utilizing an Object in order to store the difference between the current number and the target, then saving it as a key and the value is an Array that stores the index and the number needed in order to add up to the target number. If the current number is a difference in the Object and the current number plus the number needed to add up to the target is equal to the target, we return the indexes. Took me quite a while to figure out.
- Valid Parenthesis
- Merge Two Sorted Lists
